# Minimizing-Churn-of-subscription-product-through-usage-analysis
Build a model predicting which customers are likely to cancel subscription by analyzing the use of the application and their habbits.

# Problem statement

This project continues to explore how machine learning can optimize digital app's revenues. It can be looked at in parallel of , covered separately.

The main source of revenues for many mobile / digital applications comes from subscription. Subscriptions provide a continuous flow of revenues making it possible to finance growth and new dvelopments. Companies want to reduce customer churn as much as possible and retain customers. Since customer acquisition is expensive, being able to keep the customer is extremely valuable.

To retain customers, companies must be able to identify behavorial patterns giving early warnings of customer disengagement (like customers starting to lose interest in the service). Being able to identify early signs catalyst to disengagement gives a tremendous opportunity to re-engage these customers.

This project aims to build a model predicting which customers are likely to churn so that the company can focus on them. The company can strat developping new features that customers would be interested in or provide information on value-added services the user did not realize or has forgotten about.

This objective can apply to a wide variety of business cases and subscription services, assuming the company has the user's usage data available: What are the functionalities used, how is the customer interacting, etc...

# Context
In this project, we use as a business case the example of a mobile app offering financial / banking services: loans application, credit card offering, purchases and deposits for example.
We assume that, by subscribing, customers have provided data on their financial situation and how they use the service. There is also likely demographic information acquired during the sign-up process.
